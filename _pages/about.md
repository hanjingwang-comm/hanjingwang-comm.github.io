I am a Ph.D. candidate in School of Communication at [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://comm.hkbu.edu.hk/). Before joining the Ph.D. program, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Economics at Nanjing University and master's degrees in Economics at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Chinese University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen.

My research interests are computational social science and social scripts in human-machine communication. I am lucky to be mentored by Prof. Stephanie Jean Tsang and Dr. Andrew Gambino. Currently, I'm working on projects on human-machine romantic relationships. Feel free to reach out if you are also interested!

Some of my previous works were accepted/published in distinguished venues in communication and social science such as the Journal of Medical Internet Research, annual conferences of the International Communication Association (ICA), The International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR), Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC) and IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW).
