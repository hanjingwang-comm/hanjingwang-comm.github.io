I am a Ph.D. candidate in [School of Communication at Hong Kong Baptist University](https://comm.hkbu.edu.hk/) and a visiting scholar at [University of Delaware](https://www.udel.edu/). Before joining the Ph.D. program, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Economics at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) and master's degrees in Economics at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/) and [Chinese University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en).

My research interests are computational social science and social scripts in human-machine communication. I am lucky to be mentored by [Prof. Stephanie Jean Tsang](https://coms.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/stephanie-jean-tsang.html) and [Dr. Andrew Gambino](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/cas/units/departments/communication/our-people/andrew-gambino/). Currently, I'm working on projects on human-machine romantic relationships. Feel free to reach out if you are also interested!

Some of my previous works were accepted/published in distinguished venues in communication and social science such as the *Journal of Medical Internet Research*, annual conferences of *The International Communication Association (ICA)*, *The International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR)*, *Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC)* and *IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems Workshops (ICDCSW)*.
